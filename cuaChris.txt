Map two keys next to space bar, usually: <SPECIAL>
Left Super and Right Super or
Left Windows and Right Windows or
Left Cmd and Right Cmd or
Left Alt and Right Alt or
Left Ctrl and Right Ctrl

Use key at far left for window manager: <ALTERNATIVE>
Can be Ctrl or Fn or etc

=== Notes

Ctrl-<x> and Ctrl-Shift-<x> are identical in terminals, remap using .Xresources

Shift page up/down doesnt work, captured by xterm, remap using .Xresources

Super/Windows/Cmd key not recognised by terminal, remap using .Xresources

Some Alt key clashes in intellij, tries to open menu, add disable-mnemonics="false"!!
